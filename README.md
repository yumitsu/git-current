git-current
===========

### Description
`git-current` is a small unobtrusive tool that adds 2 handy aliases to `git` standart commands &mdash; `pull-current` and `push-current`, that equivalent to `git (pull|push) <current-remote> <current-working-branch>`.

### Why?
It becomes *very* convenient when you have to deal with a *ton* of branches during development: aliases are shorter than full command, you don't need to remember working branch name, there is no chance for typo etc.

### "Just go, read 'man git-config' and set ya git properly, scrub!"
Yeah, yeah, ~~just go fuck yourself~~ I heard you mom.
